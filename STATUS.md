---

## Milestones
- [x] **M1 — Foundation** ✅ DONE
  - Godot project + 8 autoloads (EventBus, Db, GameClock, WorldState, PlayerData, Economy, SaveManager, Audio)
  - GameClock: real WIB time, day/night CanvasModulate curve, synodic moon phase (8-frame sprite), sky_calendar events
  - Player: 8-dir movement, 4-facing anim, camera; Greenvale region from Field/Nature tilesets; props; boundaries
  - HUD: clock/moon/weather, HP/MP/EXP, gold/level, Sky Report, toasts
  - Weather system + rain particles
- [x] **M2 — Combat** ✅ DONE
  - CombatResolver (GDD formulas), MonsterFactory (BST×archetype), 3+ monsters (Fluffbit/Wolf/Slime + 7 Greenvale)
  - Geometric melee (facing cone), 2 skills (flame_slash/spark_bolt), dodge, projectile, HP bars, damage numbers, death→drop+EXP+levelup, slime split
  - Verified in headless combat demo: player↔monster damage, **kill→loot→levelup chain confirmed**
- [x] **M3 — Elements** ✅ DONE
  - elements.json matrix (1.3/1.0/0.7) + science rules; elem_mod + chain tested
  - Element Flow infusion (Fire/Lightning, keys 1/2) with pulsing aura + HUD indicator
  - Fire swing uses fire_flow VFX; lightning chain draws arcs between **wet** monsters only
  - Rain → monsters show wet droplet markers → Lightning chains (verified: 1 direct + 3 chain hits/swing); Fire −30% vs wet (unit-tested)
- [x] **M4 — Taming & pet** ✅ DONE
  - TamingSystem roll (rarity×orb×weather×skill + pity), HP<5% gate, orb consume, enrage on fail — tested
  - Pet follows player + auto-fights nearby enemies (ally marker); PetManager keeps active pet spawned
  - Mount toggle (R) for Medium+ rideable pets → speed boost, pet hides
  - Fixed critical sprite bug (see BUGS.md #1) that affected all monsters
- [x] **M5 — Gathering & crafting** ✅ DONE
  - GatherNode: chop trees / mine copper with respawn (real-time), hits + drops
  - MenuUI overlay (pauses game): Inventory (equip/use), Crafting (7 recipes, success%, insight on fail), Shop (buy/sell)
  - CraftingSystem (consume/roll/base-preserve on fail) + Economy supply-demand — tested
  - Bench + Shop NPC interactables (E to open)
- [x] **M6 — Homestead** ✅ DONE
  - Separate Homestead instance (portal travel both ways), day/night, HUD/menu
  - 4 plots: plant mint/sunbud seeds → grow in real WIB time (offline growth via planted_at_unix delta) → harvest → product (sellable)
  - Growth stages visible; HomesteadSystem tested (backdated plots ready, young not)
- [x] **M7 — Hidden Scenario** ✅ DONE
  - Silent `rabbits_killed` counter (no UI); ScenarioManager trigger = threshold + full moon + sleep_at_inn
  - Shipping threshold **10000** (verified); debug 10 via AETHER_DEBUG_SCENARIO env
  - Inn interactable (sleep) triggers; Lunar Warren: survive 60s, don't kill rabbits, chased by Moon Rabbit Berserker
  - no_fail: cleared/failed written permanently to save; clear → Carrot of Calamity [S] + Moon element unlock (tested)
- [x] **M8 — Polish** ✅ DONE
  - Main Menu (New Game / Load 3 slots / Mode Hemat / Mute / Quit) with live Sky Report + moon icon + birth-sign
  - Save/Load 3 slots + backup rotation + schema_version + atomic write (roundtrip tested)
  - In-game system menu (Esc): Save/Load slots, Options, back to Main Menu
  - Mode Hemat (30fps cap, weather VFX off), persisted to user://settings.cfg
  - Element icons (original assets) in HUD; per-scene music; full HUD

## Now
**ALL 8 MILESTONES COMPLETE + §4 underway.** Fase 0 feature-complete. **72/72 tests**, 0 headless errors.
Done in §4:
- EVALUATION.md (8/8 acceptance met), MARKET_STUDY.md (ATM).
- Post-launch features: **Achievements+Titles** (neutral micro-buffs) + **Aetherpedia** (menu "Pedia" tab).
- **Bug sweep complete**: full-codebase review found 7 bugs → all fixed → regression tests added (see BUGS.md).
Autoloads now 11 (added Settings, ScenarioManager, Achievements). **Zero known bugs.**

Note: headless test run may report OS exit 255 (Godot exit-cleanup artifact re: tweens/timers) — the
printed `RESULT: N passed, 0 failed` line is authoritative, not the process exit code.

## Next steps (exact) — for the next session, resume here
1. Fold in any remaining bug-hunt findings → BUGS.md → fix.
2. MARKET_STUDY remaining picks: **Daily Quest Board** (roll from WIB day+weather+moon), **Photo Mode**
   (hide HUD + free cam), then **Fishing minigame** (fish by hour/tide). All data-driven + tested.
3. Content expansion: add Candyveil Meadows region + its 8 monsters (Monster_Roster §2.2) as pure JSON +
   a portal; add more recipes; wire evolutions (fluffbit→moonbit on full moon).
4. Re-tune combat swarm damage; consider re-tinting/replacing beast.png so "Grey Wolf" reads grey.

## How to run (reminder)
- Game: `run_godot.bat`  (boots MainMenu)
- Tests: `run_godot.bat --headless res://tests/TestRunner.tscn --quit-after 40`  (expect 63 passed)
- Verify a scene + screenshot: `godot --path game res://scenes/Main.tscn` with env `AETHER_SHOT=1`
  (demos: AETHER_COMBAT / AETHER_ELEM / AETHER_PET / AETHER_MENU / AETHER_HOME / AETHER_WARREN_SHOT)
- Hidden Scenario debug (threshold 10, bypass full-moon): env `AETHER_DEBUG_SCENARIO=1`

## Health
- Headless: 0 errors. Test suite: **34/34 pass**.
- Known bugs: none. See BUGS.md (created at first bug).
